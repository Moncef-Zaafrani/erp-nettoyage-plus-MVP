Lets do a quick remodel of the nav bars! 
look at screenshots, i find it better orgonised this way, and it looks better (these are screenshots by AI, so many mistakes in generation, so adapt the stuff to our work intelegently, not as is, we have extra features and stuff !)

Lets work on the users + clients now, i like the idea of how the Ai generated this, i want for users, and clients to look similar, with filters, and sortings system! Also we can switch between that block look and a normal table look! 
As always lets plan ask me questions, what stuff your not sure about, the more the better we do this correctly !
